## 11. Deployment and Infrastructure

### 11.1 Current Deployment Strategy
- **Development Mode**: Separate Angular dev server (port 4200) with API proxy
- **Production Mode**: Express server serving built Angular app (single port)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM migrations
- **Environment Configuration**: Environment-based configuration management

### 11.2 Infrastructure Requirements
- **Node.js Runtime**: Version 18+ for optimal performance
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Version 12+ with UUID extension
- **Memory Requirements**: Minimum 512MB RAM for development
- **Storage**: Minimal storage requirements for application code

### 11.3 Production Deployment Requirements
- **Container Deployment**: Docker containerization for consistent deployment
- **Cloud Deployment**: Support for major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- **Load Balancing**: Horizontal scaling support with session persistence
- **Monitoring**: Application performance monitoring and logging

#### Critical Production Setup Step
**IMPORTANT**: After building the Angular client, you must copy the index file:
```bash
cp client-angular/dist/client-angular/browser/index.csr.html client-angular/dist/client-angular/browser/index.html
```
This step is required for the production Express server to serve the Angular application correctly. Without this step, the production server will return 404 errors.

---

## 12. Known Issues and Limitations

### 12.1 Current Known Issues

#### Build Warnings
- **CSS Budget Warning**: Angular build produces warnings for component styles exceeding the 15kB budget limit
  - Warning: `angular:styles/component exceeded maximum budget. Budget 15.36 kB was not met by 2.26 kB with a total of 17.62 kB`
  - Impact: Does not affect functionality but may require budget adjustment for production
  - Workaround: Increase budget limits in `angular.json` or optimize component styles

#### Production Deployment
- **Index File Requirement**: Manual step required to copy `index.csr.html` to `index.html` after Angular build
  - Without this step, production server returns 404 errors
  - This should be automated in future build scripts

#### Development Dependencies
- **Legacy Peer Dependencies**: Root npm install requires `--legacy-peer-deps` flag due to version conflicts
  - Impact: Slightly longer installation times
  - Future: Resolve dependency conflicts in package.json

### 12.2 Current Limitations

#### Data Storage
- **In-Memory Storage**: Currently uses in-memory storage for development/demo purposes
- **Data Persistence**: Data is reset on server restart
- **Migration Required**: Need to implement persistent database connection for production use

#### Feature Limitations
- **Single-User Mode**: No multi-user authentication or authorization system
- **Real-time Collaboration**: No real-time collaborative editing features
- **Advanced Export**: Limited document export formats (FRS generation available)
- **File Uploads**: No file upload or attachment capabilities

#### Scalability Considerations
- **Session Storage**: Uses memory-based session storage (not suitable for multi-instance deployment)
- **Database Connections**: No connection pooling or advanced database optimizations
- **Caching**: No caching layer for improved performance

### 12.3 Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: Tested and working on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design works on mobile devices
- **JavaScript Requirements**: Requires JavaScript enabled (no graceful degradation)
